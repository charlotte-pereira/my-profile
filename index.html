		<h1>MY HOBBIES</h1>

		<div class="box-white">
			<h2>Cooking</h2>
			<p>I started cooking thanks to my father who was a cooker during his youth and my speciality is obviously cookies because it is really easy to make and very tasty.</p>

		<div class="box-white">
			<h2>Shopping</h2>
			<p>I think I have developped a little addiction to shopping in the last two years and my mom won't disagree. But, I am searching more and more for thrifted clothes.</p>

			<h2>Reading</h2>
			<p>Since the beginning of the year, I started reading regularly and I like reading very classical books to enrish my culture.</p>
